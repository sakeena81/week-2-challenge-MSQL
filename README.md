#WHAT WAS THE CHALLENGE?

TO use MYsql witjin our VMs, to create a database with dummy data within four seperate tables. 
Tables to be named: 
    * **Category** 
    * **Subcategory**
    * **Product**
    * **Sales**
    
These tables were to be used as part of 6 set queries to show our skill in completing joins in our codes. 

Furthermore to create a ERD diagram to display the relationship between the 4 tables

#WHAT WENT WELL?
Creating a database, and tables was a straightfoward task. 

Furthermore having lots of previous screenshots, and notes of my own work, helped me to remember many of the processes involved in keepinmg to the logic of Mysql.

The ERD diagram was straightfoward, plural site and QA community cover a great deal of ground with MYsql, however without the help of my fellow team and Shafeeq, I was able to complete lots of areas. 


#WHAT DIDNT GO AS PLANNED?
the first mistake I made, was the lack of dummy data, I kept my tables far too basic, which left me eith empty queries, even when my codinG was correct, this meant that I lost time in having to INSERT more rows of data, therefore my attention was split between rectifying my earlier basic data and trying to understand my code. 
I should have taken screenshots of my work in MYsql as I worked thorughout the day, my VM crashed, possibly either due to being open for too long, or the trial and errors of my coding. 

Also, I tried with the help of other TDPrs to push myssql work to Github, however this i was unable to do, even with screenshare on via teams, no one could figure out how to do this, i resolved to take screenshots of my process, however, this may have caused the VM to crash, it was dissapointing, but I do not give up, and am glad that I took the time to re-do the challenge over the weekend.  

#POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE FUTURE. 
To plan possibly on paper roughly how I plan to construct my data, this allows me as the user to have a VM open for a shorter time, and can reduce errors greatly. 

Ensure that I screenshot or make notes of my work as I go along, therefore even if the VM crashed my work and the codes I used would still be available to me.

To break down a problem, through the help of other TDP members, I had code that should have worked, however it didnt, so I took the time to break down the code simplify it, and see how it would fit with tables. 

Never having created any coding in MYsql before, this was an intense challenge, however its proven to me one thing, is do not be afraid to try, even if your unsure, just work at it and practice. LOTS AND LOTS OF PRACTICE! :)!!
